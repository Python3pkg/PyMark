	List of things to do!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


1. References/Pointers

	Need to decide on some syntax. I think initially it would be nice to either use $ or *
	Perhaps a bar?
	
	I'm thinking star then dots works nicely.

	"*shaders.pixel.file2"
	
	This means we'll probably need a new stage which checks references. They can be exported simply as strings, but obv. need to include type info.
	
2. Be nice to write a loader for python


3. Settings support

	settings dict in files seems to be the best way to do it.
	
	~ prefix support
	~ non compile support
	~ non pointer support
