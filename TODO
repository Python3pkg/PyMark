	List of things to do!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


1. References/Pointers

	The C# code needs to load them.
	Other than that I believe we are done.
	
2. Will need some bugfixing

3. Start of documentation?

4. Python loader class. Some other classes would be nice too.

5. More classes of course

6. The documentation - a quickstart document at least.
	Also a document of the specification of the binary format would be good.
