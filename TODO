	List of things to do!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Test if the C# implentation of references actually works half decently.

* Will need some bugfixing

* Python loader class. Some other classes would be nice too.
	How nice would it be to write a loader in C or C++ !!

* The documentation - a quickstart document at least.
	Also a document of the specification of the binary format would be good.
	
* Any other bright ideas?
	Some utility functions for pulling out flags?
	
* Friendly syntax errors
