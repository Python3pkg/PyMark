	List of things to do!!

1. References/Pointers

	Ok, looks like we're got the syntax down - it isn't exactly what I'd hoped for but it'll have to do.
	- checking references
	- construct string which we can use to get code
	- see if that code executes
	
	- warnings about character digit strings in dictionary names
	
2. Constants

	Idea is to construct a dictionary of constants based on each module - useful for flags and other things like that.
